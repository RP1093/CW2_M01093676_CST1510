    "During CST1510 Programming for Data Communication and Networks, I began exploring Python step by step, which was both challenging and fun. I started by learning the basics, like getting input from users, creating variables, performing calculations, and using loops. These helped me understand how to break problems into smaller steps and solve them one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also worked with lists, functions, and ways to organize data using sets and dictionaries. Learning how to handle files and errors showed me how to make programs that work reliably. Using Pandas to display and organize data was especially useful because it made the information easier to read and work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the challenges I faced were figuring out how to structure my code and handle repeated data or missing files. I managed these by breaking the problems into smaller steps and testing my code carefully.\n",
